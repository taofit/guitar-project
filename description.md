 ## project brief
 building guitar product listing page using html, css and javascript.
 
 ## elements
On the left hand side there is a list of filters where the user can select if he/she wants to limit the product listing to guitars from specific manufacturers.
On the right hand side in the top there is a summary of the selected filters. If the user selects a filter on the left hand side a button with the same filter value appears here.
On the right hand side below the filter summary there is a list of products.
Below the products a set of pagination controls are found

## Filters
If no manufacturer filters are selected guitars from all manufacturers are included in the product list
When the page is loaded no filters are selected
If one manufacturer filter is selected only guitars from that manufacturer are shown in the product list
If several manufacturer filters are selected guitars from all the selected manufacturers are shown

## Filter summary
The filter summary always reflects the filters that are selected on the left; there will be one button in the filter summary per selected filter
Clicking one of the summary buttons will deselect the corresponding filter

## Product List:
The guitars shown in the products list will always be limited to guitars from the manufacturers selected in the filters or all guitars in case no filters have been selected 
Only 12 guitars will be shown per page
Each guitar product card in the list should contain an image of the guitar (if available), the name of the guitar, the manufacturer and maybe the manufacturerâ€™s logo (when available), plus other product information. Maybe the description and/or other fields.
Images for the guitars and logos should all be included in the zip file

## Pagination
Include buttons for moving to the next and previous pages in the product list
When on the first page the button going to the previous page should be disabled
When on the last page the button going to the next page should be disabled
There should be an indication of the current page
There should be an indication of the total number of pages
